# Engagement Insight Engine - Technical Report

**Project:** Engagement Insight Engine  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** June 2025  
**Author:** Ramesh Kuntigorla
**Repository:** [https://github.com/FalconSlayer51/engagement-insight-engine]

---

## 1. Project Overview

The **Engagement Insight Engine** is a machine learning-powered system designed to enhance user engagement in educational platforms by intelligently generating personalized nudges. The system addresses the critical challenge of maintaining user engagement through data-driven insights and predictive modeling.

### Problem Statement

Educational platforms often struggle with user retention and engagement. Students may lose interest due to lack of motivation, peer pressure, or insufficient personalized guidance. Traditional engagement strategies are often generic and fail to account for individual user behavior patterns and peer dynamics.

### Objective

Develop an intelligent system that:

- Analyzes user behavior patterns and peer dynamics
- Predicts optimal moments for engagement interventions
- Generates personalized, context-aware nudges
- Improves overall platform engagement metrics

### High-Level Outcome

The system successfully implements a hybrid approach combining rule-based logic with machine learning models to generate three types of engagement nudges:

- **Profile Nudges**: Encourage resume uploads and profile completion
- **Event Nudges**: Promote event participation based on FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) scoring
- **Quiz Nudges**: Suggest knowledge assessment activities

The final system achieves **96% accuracy** for resume prediction and **81% accuracy** for event prediction, demonstrating strong predictive capabilities for engagement optimization.

## 2. Dataset Description

### Data Sources

The project utilizes two primary datasets:

1. **Event Engagement Dataset** (`event_dataset.csv`)

   - **Size:** 10,002 records
   - **Features:** karma points, event FOMO score
   - **Target:** should_nudge_event (binary: 0/1)

2. **Resume Upload Dataset** (`balanced_resume_dataset_realistic_noisy.csv`)
   - **Size:** 10,002 records
   - **Features:** resume_uploaded status, batch resume upload percentage
   - **Target:** should_nudge_resume (binary: 0/1)

### Data Format

Both datasets are in CSV format with the following structure:

**Event Dataset Columns:**

- `karma`: User karma points (continuous, range: 40-510)
- `event_fomo_score`: Calculated FOMO score (continuous, range: 0-1)
- `should_nudge_event`: Target variable (binary)

**Resume Dataset Columns:**

- `resume_uploaded`: Current resume status (binary: 0/1)
- `batch_resume_uploaded_pct`: Percentage of peers with resumes (continuous, range: 0-1)
- `should_nudge_resume`: Target variable (binary)

### Target Variables

- **Primary Target:** Binary classification for nudge generation
- **Secondary Target:** FOMO score calculation for event engagement

### Data Challenges

1. **Class Imbalance**: Initial datasets showed imbalanced target distributions
2. **Noise in Data**: Realistic noise was added to simulate real-world conditions
3. **Feature Correlation**: Karma and FOMO scores show moderate correlation
4. **Temporal Aspects**: Event attendance patterns vary over time

---

## 3. Data Preprocessing

### Missing Value Handling

- No missing values detected in the final datasets
- Robust data generation process ensures complete records

### Feature Engineering

1. **FOMO Score Calculation**:

   ```python
   # Custom algorithm combining:
   # - Buddy attendance factor (40% weight)
   # - Batch attendance factor (30% weight)
   # - Time decay factor (30% weight)
   ```

2. **Feature Scaling**:
   - MinMaxScaler for neural network models
   - No scaling required for Random Forest models

### Data Balancing

- Applied balanced sampling techniques to address class imbalance
- Created realistic noisy datasets for robust model training
- Maintained 50-50 split for training and testing

### Encoding

- Binary features: Direct integer encoding (0/1)
- Categorical features: One-hot encoding where applicable
- Date features: Converted to days since last event

---

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Key Visualizations

#### Event Dataset Distribution

```
Target Variable Distribution:
- should_nudge_event = 0: ~60% (6,007 records)
- should_nudge_event = 1: ~40% (3,995 records)

Karma Points Distribution:
- Mean: 300.45
- Standard Deviation: 120.67
- Range: 40.75 - 509.65

FOMO Score Distribution:
- Mean: 0.52
- Standard Deviation: 0.23
- Range: 0.17 - 0.91
```

#### Resume Dataset Distribution

```
Target Variable Distribution:
- should_nudge_resume = 0: ~64% (6,400 records)
- should_nudge_resume = 1: ~36% (3,602 records)

Batch Resume Upload Percentage:
- Mean: 0.65
- Standard Deviation: 0.28
- Range: 0.02 - 1.00
```

### Statistical Insights

1. **Correlation Analysis**:

   - Karma and FOMO scores show moderate positive correlation (r = 0.34)
   - Resume upload status and batch percentage show weak correlation (r = 0.12)

2. **Feature Importance**:

   - FOMO score is the strongest predictor for event nudges
   - Batch resume percentage is the strongest predictor for resume nudges

3. **Temporal Patterns**:
   - Users with recent event attendance show lower FOMO scores
   - Higher karma users tend to have more consistent engagement patterns

1. **Neural Networks (TensorFlow/Keras)**

   - Architecture: 2 hidden layers (64, 32 neurons)
   - Activation: ReLU with BatchNormalization and Dropout
   - Output: Sigmoid for binary classification

2. **Random Forest Classifier**

   - Estimators: 100 trees
   - Max depth: None (unlimited)
   - Random state: 42 for reproducibility

3. **Support Vector Machines** (briefly explored)
   - Limited exploration due to computational complexity

### Evaluation Metrics
